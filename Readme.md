## üì¶ Packaging & Sharing as a .crx Extension

Want to share this extension with your team without using the Chrome Web Store? You can package it as a `.crx` file:

1. **Open Chrome and go to** `chrome://extensions`.
2. **Enable Developer mode** (top right).
3. **Click "Pack extension"** (top left).
4. **Select the extension root directory** (the folder containing your manifest and code).
5. **Click "Pack Extension".**
   - Chrome will generate a `.crx` file and a private key (`.pem`).
6. **Share the `.crx` file** with your teammates.
7. **To install:**
   - Drag and drop the `.crx` file into `chrome://extensions` (with Developer mode enabled).
   - Confirm the installation prompt.

**Note:** If you update the extension code, you must repackage and redistribute the `.crx` file. However, blocklist updates are automatic via the Google Doc!
